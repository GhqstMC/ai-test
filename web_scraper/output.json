The file "web_scraper/output.json" is a JSON file where the scraped data will be stored. As it's a JSON file, it doesn't contain any code. It will be created and filled with data by the Scrapy pipeline during the scraping process. Initially, it can be empty or not exist at all. The Scrapy pipeline will create it if it doesn't exist.

So, there's no code to generate for this file. It will be automatically handled by the Scrapy pipeline.
